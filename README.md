# Auditory-Music-Program
The end-result of a two-term Freshman Design course project between several classmates and myself. This program was designed with the purpose of allowing the user to import a sheet music file, and then display an appropriately-processed version of this sheet music on a mobile display by scrolling it across said screen. The names of all team members involved can be found in the repository's readme file.
